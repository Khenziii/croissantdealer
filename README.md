# !!!WARNING!!!
At the moment, the whole code is just boilerplate. The bot is not actually "thinking" yet. Working on it :)

# croissantdealer
croissantdealer is a simple chess bot. He probably isn't the toughest enemy that you've ever faced, but it's defienietly fun to create him! :) (He also is an absolute chad that never plays e4 ;>) And no, he doesn't sell croissants.
